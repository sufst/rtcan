# RTCAN

## About

RTCAN (Real-Time CAN) is a ThreadX RTOS service for managing concurrent access 
to CAN peripherals on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Usage

TBD

## Other Platforms

This implementation was developed for the STM32 platform, however it should be
relatively simple to port to another platform with a different HAL.
